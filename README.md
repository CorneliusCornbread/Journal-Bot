# Journal-Bot
A bot used to answer my schools stupid journal prompts. It works by selecting a random inspirational quote from the quotes.json file. It outputs it to the output folder with the current days date.

This was made using VSCode, if you want to use the project then use VSCode and use `dotnet run` to run the program.
